/// RuntimeFilters are produced and consumed by plan nodes at run time to propagate
/// predicates across the plan tree dynamically. Each fragment instance manages its
/// filters with a RuntimeFilterBank which provides low-synchronization access to filter
/// objects and data structures.
///
/// A RuntimeFilterBank manages both production and consumption of filters. In the case
/// where a given filter is both consumed and produced by the same fragment, the
/// RuntimeFilterBank treats each filter independently.
///
/// All filters must be registered with the filter bank via RegisterFilter(). Local plan
/// fragments update the bloom filters by calling UpdateFilterFromLocal()
/// (UpdateFilterFromLocal() may only be called once per filter ID per filter bank). The
/// bloom_filter that is passed into UpdateFilterFromLocal() must have been allocated by
/// AllocateScratchBloomFilter(); this allows RuntimeFilterBank to manage all memory
/// associated with filters.
///
/// Filters are aggregated at the coordinator, and then made available to consumers after
/// PublishGlobalFilter() has been called.
///
/// After PublishGlobalFilter() has been called (and again, it may only be called once per
/// filter_id), the RuntimeFilter object associated with filter_id will have a valid
/// bloom_filter, and may be used for filter evaluation. This operation occurs without
/// synchronisation, and neither the thread that calls PublishGlobalFilter() nor the
/// thread that may call RuntimeFilter::Eval() need to coordinate in any way.
