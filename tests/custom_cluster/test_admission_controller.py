  (parameterized) and the ability to submit to one impalad or many in a round-robin

  over the state that the admission controller uses to make decisions.  Each query is
  submitted on a separate thread. Depending on the test parameters a varying number of
  queries will be admitted, queued, and rejected. Once queries are admitted, the query
  execution blocks and we can cancel the query in order to allow another queued query to
  be admitted.

  The test tracks the state of the admission controller using the metrics from each
  impalad to do the following:
  (1) After submitting all queries, the change in metrics for the number of admitted,
      queued, and rejected requests should sum to the number of queries and that the
      values are reasonable given the test parameters.
  (2) While there are running queries:
      * Cancel the currently running queries (they are blocked with the WAIT debug action)
        and verify the metric for the number of completed queries. The threads that
        submitted those queries should complete.
      * Check that queued requests are then dequeued and verify using the metric for the
        number of dequeued requests. The threads that were waiting to submit the query
        should then insert themselves into a list of currently running queries and then
        fetch() the results (which will block).
  (3) After all queries have completed, check that the final number of admitted,
      queued, and rejected requests are reasonable given the test parameters. When
      submitting to a single impalad, we know exactly what the values should be,
      otherwise we just check that they are within reasonable bounds.
