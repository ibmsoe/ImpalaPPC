# Regression test for IMPALA-3141: Disabled filters should send dummy filters
# to unblock waiters. Filters are disabled by setting the filter size to be very
# small, and having a large enough build input to trigger the false-positive check.
# Note: build side has a low NDV, so if the FP estimate changes to take NDV into
# account this test will need to be updated.
