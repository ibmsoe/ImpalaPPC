# TODO: the distributed agg tests have a high likely of becoming flaking. The memory is
# split between the local and merge agg in an uncontrolled way which can lead to
# pathological cases causing the queries to fail with OOM. These cases are expected
# to be unlikely with reasonable limits but we are explicitly trying to pick very low
# limits. (IMPALA-1305)
