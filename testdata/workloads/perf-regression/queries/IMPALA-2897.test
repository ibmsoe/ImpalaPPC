---- QUERY: IMPALA-2897
# In a right outer join, build side rows that are equivalent (where nulls are considered
# equivalent) should compare equal and be placed in the same hash bucket. If they compare
# unequal and hash to different buckets, this query exhibits quadratic runtime.
#
# We have to use an expression (rather than just NULL) in the inner SELECTs because of
# IMPALA-2909.
